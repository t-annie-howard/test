Early learning center map. This example is for the UPP 465 course to show how to add and style geoJson data to a leaflet map. 

index.html contains the full example from the lecture, including two geojson files both styled with conditions.  

index_pointsAreRedOnly.html contains only the point layer with simple styling, for reference.  

Both link to style.css & the early learning centers geojson.
